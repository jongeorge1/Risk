                     PSA (prostate specific antigen) is a substance, produced by normal prostate cells, which leaks into the bloodstream where it can be measured. PSA is produced more rapidly when prostate cancer is growing (both in the prostate or elsewhere in the body). Regular PSA tests are an important part of follow-up after treatment.</p>

                        Your PSA levels should be measured every 3 – 6 months. If your PSA level doubles
                        within 2 years, you must contact your HCP.</p>

                        If the PSA level then rises an additional 2.0ng/ml above this lowest level, you
                        must contact your HCP.
