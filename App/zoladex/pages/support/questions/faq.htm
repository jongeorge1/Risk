                                When you have cancer it’s understandable that you want to try to take control of
                                the things that you can control. For some people this can mean making dietary or
                                lifestyle changes.</p>
                            <p>
                                Studies suggest that changes may be helpful although we need more evidence. Here
                                are some of the things that have been studied:</p>

                            <div>Should I be taking Vitamin D supplements?</div></h3>

                            <p>
                                Scientists are still unsure about the role that vitamin D plays in prostate cancer.
                                There are a couple of reasons why you might consider taking Vitamin D supplements:</p>
                            <p>
                                <h4>Vitamin D may slow the progression of prostate cancer</h4>
                                Research in America suggests that taking Vitamin D supplements can slow down the
                                cancer’s growth.</p>
                            <p>
                                <h4>Vitamin D can help to prevent bone loss</h4>
                                Unfortunately hormone therapy can cause your bones to thin (osteoporosis), making
                                you vulnerable to fractures. Before starting treatment with Zoladex, you should
                                have had your Vitamin D levels measured because Vitamin D deficiency can make osteoporosis
                                worse.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Your doctor will be able to tell you if your Vitamin D levels are low and advise
                                you about taking supplements.</p>

                            <div>Will I be able to carry on exercising?</div></h3>
                        <p>
                            <p>
                                It all depends on the treatment you have had, how you feel and your general state
                                of health. If you have had surgery, it may be a while before you are able to get
                                back to your normal exercise routine. For the first few weeks you will need to be
                                careful, it is probably best just to do some gentle walking. This will also help
                                to prevent any blood clots forming in your legs. Once your wound has healed and
                                you begin to feel stronger, you can gradually increase the amount of exercise each
                                day. Your doctor will be able to advise you on the type of exercises that will be
                                suitable.
                            </p>

                                If you have had radiotherapy, you may feel more tired than normal and a bit sore.
                                If you feel up to it there is no reason why you shouldn’t start exercising again
                                straight away, but start gradually and work up.</p>
                            <p>
                                You may find that your bladder control is not as good as it used to be before treatment.
                                Jumping, running or coughing may make you leak urine - this is called stress incontinence.
                                Doing pelvic floor exercises regularly can help.</p>

                                Although exercising may seem more of an effort, it is worth persevering because
                                exercise:</p>

                                <li>Helps to keep weight under control - men who are obese have an increased risk of
                                    death from prostate cancer.</li>
                                <li>Helps to improve self-esteem - which can be lowered by side-¬-effects of treatment
                                </li>
                                <li>Helps to lift mood - due to the release of endorphins Before starting a new exercise
                                    programme it is always best to check with your doctor first.</li>

                                Your pelvic floor muscles are slung from your pubic bone to the end tip of your
                                backbone. Their job is to keep everything in place. Your urethra (the tube carrying
                                your urine away from the bladder) and your anus (the opening from your bowel) both
                                pass through the pelvic floor muscles. If your pelvic floor muscles are weak you
                                may find it difficult to control your flow of urine.
                            </p>
                            <h4>
                                Finding your pelvic floor muscles</h4>
                            <p>
                                Before starting pelvic floor exercises you need to try flexing them so that you
                                know where they are to make sure that you are exercising the right bits.</p>
                            <p>
                                First imagine that you need to stop yourself passing wind (farting). The muscles
                                you tighten to do this are the pelvic floor muscles around your anus.</p>
                            <p>
                                Next tighten the muscles you would use to stop yourself weeing in mid flow. These
                                are the pelvic floor muscles around your urethra.
                            </p>

                                A few pelvic floor exercises to start with</p>
                            <p>
                                Now that you knowwhere they are, you can start to exercise your pelvic floor muscles.
                                These exercises can be done sitting, standing or lying down. The more often you
                                do them, the stronger your pelvic muscles will become and the more control you will
                                have over your bladder and bowel. They can be done anytime, anywhere, whilst watching
                                the TV, doing the washing up or first thing before you get out of bed in the morning.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Pull up and hold - tighten your pelvic floor muscles right from your anus to your
                                    urethra as hard as you can and hold for a count of 5. Relax. Do this as many times
                                    as you can, gradually increasing the number every day. </li>
                                <li>Fast pull up - this time tighten your muscles as quickly as you can as many times
                                    as you can. </li>
                                <li>The lift – imagine you are using your muscles to go up in a lift. Tighten your muscles
                                    in stages, stopping at each floor (perhaps 5 in all) until you can’t tighten them
                                    any more. Gradually relax them again stopping at each floor on the way down.
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                                It’s important to remember that these symptoms can also be caused by many other

                                Hot flushes are a common side-effect of hormonal therapy. They vary in severity.
                                Some men just feel a bit hot or prickly; others go red in the face and sweat profusely.</p>
                            <p>
                                If you suffer from hot flushes, you may feel very self-conscious about it. You may

                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cutting down on alcohol, caffeine and spicy food.</li>
                            <li>Keeping the room cool</li>
                            <li>Using cotton sheets and clothing</li>
                            <li>Dressing in layers which can quickly be removed </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            If your symptoms are very severe, it might be worth asking your doctor about treatments
                            that may help you.</p>

                            Some men find that complementary therapies such as auricular acupuncture can help

                                for men with prostate cancer. For some men, it can become such a big issue that
                                they dread going out in case they are suddenly caught short.</p>

                                It is important not to let your urinary problems rule your life. You still need
                                to go out for your own sanity as much as for anything else. There are things you
                                can do to help:</p>
                            <ul>

                                <li>Obtain a <strong>Just can’t wait</strong> card. The card states that you have a
                                    medical condition that means you require the urgent need of a toilet. You can use
                                    it to show to shopkeepers or in other situations when you need a toilet without
                                    having the embarrassment of having to ask if you can use their toilet and explaining
                                    why. You can also use it to show to people if there is a long queue for the only
                                    toilet around. To find out how to get a <strong>just can’t wait</strong> card go

                                The injection has been specially formulated to release the active ingredient at

                            <p>
                                The digital rectal examination is a good way for doctors to assess your prostate.
                                When you were first diagnosed you will have had this test and may not need it again.
                                If the doctor decides that they need to feel your prostate again, or do an ultrasound,
                                you can ask why. Knowing why this test is important for you, and how it can influence
                                decisions, might make a few moments of indignity seem more worthwhile.
                            </p>

                            <div>I’ve had my prostate removed, but my PSA is still high - what does this mean?</div></h3>
                        <p>
                            <p>
                                The idea of prostate removal (radical prostatectomy) is to remove all the cancer
                                cells so they can’t spread round the body. With no prostate to make PSA, levels
                                should fall. Radiation therapy has similar aims.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If the PSA level does not fall, or continues to rise, this can mean the cancer is
                                still in the ‘prostate bed’ (the area around the prostate) or that it had already
                                spread before the surgery or radiotherapy.</p>
                            <p>
                                Sometimes doctors look at PSA doubling time to predict spread of disease. A PSA
                                doubling time of less than 3 months is associated with more serious disease.</p>
                            <p>
                                This can be a disappointing outcome, but there are still many treatment options
                                that your specialist can consider. The choice will depend on whether the cancer
                                remains in, or near the prostate, or whether it has spread.</p>

                                Men who have confirmed prostate cancer will have a Gleason score and their cancer
                                will have been ‘staged’.</p>
                            <p>
                                Because these two aspects of diagnosis are important in making treatment decisions
                                you will have probably been told what they are. They may even have been written
                                down for you. But when there’s a lot to take in it’s easy to forget what’s been

                            You do not have to tell your employer that you have been diagnosed with prostate
                            cancer. However there are several reasons why it is a good idea to do so:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It will make it easier to ask for time off work if you need to go to a hospital
                                appointment or have to have more treatment. </li>
                            <li>Your employer may be able to make adjustments to your job or working conditions
                                to make the job less tiring and allow you to carry on working for longer. </li>
                            <li>It will allow your employer to make arrangements for others to cover you if you
                                are off sick or need to work fewer hours.</li>
                        </ul>

                                You may be worried that your boss will try to get rid of you if he knows you have
                                cancer. Fortunately these days you are protected by employment law. If you feel
                                that you are being discriminated against in any way because of your prostate cancer,
                                you can get advice on what to do from your local Citizens Advice Bureau. To find

                            <div>I’ve already got annual travel insurance – do I need to tell them about my diagnosis?</div>
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            <p>
                                Most annual travel insurance policies require you to tell them if you are diagnosed
                                with a new condition such as prostate cancer. They may also want to know about any
                                tests, treatments or changes to medication that you may have.</p>
                            <p>
                                If you do not tell them, it could invalidate your policy and they may not pay any
                                claims you make. If you do make a claim, the insurance company may write to your
                                GP to get your medical information, so it pays to be honest.</p>
                            <p>
                                It is always best to read your insurance policy carefully and provide the insurance
                                company with correct, up-to-date and complete information about your medical condition.</p>

                        <p>
                            Because prostate cancer can run in families your sons and brothers are at higher
                            risk of prostate cancer. Because of this increased risk male relatives might want
                            to consider prostate cancer screening. This is something that each relative should
                            discuss with their own GP.

                        <p>
                            No. From April 2009 the government abolished prescription charges for everyone undergoing
                            treatment for:

                        <p>
                            To get your free prescription you will need to:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Fill in an application form (form FP92A) to obtain a 5-year exemption certificate
                                for prescription charges – this form should be available from your GP or cancer
                                clinic. </li>
                            <li>Ask your GP or hospital doctor to countersign the form </li>
                            <li>Send the completed form to the address given</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            If after 5 years you still need treatment, you can renew your exemption certificate.</p>
